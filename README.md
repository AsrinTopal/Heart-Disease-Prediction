# Heart Disease Prediction App ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is a web application built using **Streamlit** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health factors. The app leverages machine learning models, specifically a **Random Forest Classifier**, to analyze input data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other vital health metrics to predict the risk of heart disease.

## Overview

The **Heart Disease Prediction App** uses the **Heart Disease Dataset** available on Kaggle to train a machine learning model. Users can input their health information (such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, etc.) into the app to receive a prediction of their heart disease risk. The app also provides features like visualizing the feature importance and the prediction probabilities.

This app helps raise awareness about heart disease and can serve as an educational tool for understanding heart health.

## Features

- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Based on the user's input, the app predicts whether the user has a high or low risk of heart disease.
- **Model Performance**: Displays the model's training and test accuracy.
- **Feature Importance**: Visualizes the importance of each feature in the model's decision-making.
- **Probability Visualization**: Displays the probability of having heart disease using a pie chart.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the app is interactive and easy to use.

## Installation
